## What is a component based framework 

A component based framework  allows the user to seperate elements into smaller components. This allows the user to reuse elements across their project (or across multiple if using a component library like Storybook). It also allow for greater seperation of concerns.

A very good way to understand it is by looking at the atomic design pattern. Atomic design works by seperating a design into smaller pieces (atoms, molecules, organisms, templates, pages).
